## üìö Introduction

**OTAF** (Open Tolerance Analysis Framework) is an open-source Python library designed for statistical tolerance analysis and modeling of overconstrained 3D mechanical assemblies. It provides tools to model defects at the feature level, perform reliability analysis, and estimate the statistical effect of tolerance choices on the variability of quantities of interest (primarily the probability of non-assembly). Additionally, OTAF offers a foundation for constructing a System of Constraints (SOC)-based assembly model automatically, given a minimal representation of the assembly and its components.

Key use cases include:
- **Construction of a SOC Model**: Automatically construct the linear problem modeling the assembly.
- **Modeling Manufacturing Deviations**: Analyze the effects of geometric and dimensional variations.
- **Probability of Failure Estimation**: Use advanced statistical tools to quantify and mitigate risks (Monte Carlo, FORM, SORM, GLD).
- **Imprecise Probability of Failure Estimation**: Apply methods developed in an upcoming paper [COMING SOON] to model the space of possible defects.

### Limitations
- **Only Rigid Transformations**: Only rigid defects (translations and rotations) are modeled.
- **Limited Feature Types**: Currently supports only planar and cylindrical features.
- **No Tools for Tolerance Allocation**: Users must implement this on their own after generating the SOC model.
- **Not Production-Ready**: Apart from SOC model construction, the rest of the program is in an alpha stage and may remain so. Use at your discretion.

This package was developed to explore experimental approaches based on imprecise probabilities. For more details, refer to the associated paper.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### General Form Of The Assembly Data Dictionary To Pass to the `AssemblyDataProcessor`
The `AssemblyDataProcessor` takes as an input a minimal representation of the assembly in the form of a dictionary, that needs to be constructed manually.
Some specific notation choices have been made on how to represent features and assemblies.
Parts are always represented by a number, surfaces always by a lowercase letter, and point on the surface always as the letters of the surface in uppercase with a number following it.
So for Part number 1 on surface aa and point AA1 can be written like this :
P1aaAA1

The point with index 0 is always the origin point of the feature!

The system data dictionary may look like this :

```python

system_data = {
    "PARTS" : {
        '1' : {
            "a" : {
                "FRAME": RP1a, # Array of size 3x3 with each component being the x,y,z unit vectors for the local frame of the surface (x positive outwards for planar features)
                "POINTS": {'A0' : P1A0, 'A1' : P1A1, 'A2' : P1A2}, # Dictionary mapping point names to the coordinate as numpy array
                "TYPE": "plane", # Type of the feature
                "INTERACTIONS": ['P2a'], # The other feature this feature is interacting with
                "CONSTRAINTS_D": ["PERFECT"], # We can constrain the defect vector D to be 0 so there is no defect modelled on this feature
                "CONSTRAINTS_G": ["FLOATING"], # We can constrain components on the gap vector G at the feature level
            },
        ...
        ...
        },
        '2' : {
            "a" : {
                "FRAME": RP2a,
                "POINTS": {'A0' : P2A0, 'A1' : P2A1, 'A2' : P2A2},
                "TYPE": "plane",
                "INTERACTIONS": ['P1a'],
                "CONSTRAINTS_D": ["PERFECT"], # In this modelization, only defects on the right side
                "CONSTRAINTS_G": ["FLOATING"],
            },
        ...
        ...
        }
    },
    "LOOPS": {
        "COMPATIBILITY": {
            "L0": "P1cC0 -> P2cC0 -> P2aA0 -> P1aA0", #Minimal representation of the compatibility loops
            "L1": "P1cC0 -> P2cC0 -> P2bB0 -> P1bB0",
        },
    },
    "GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS": "2D_NZ",
}
```

Information about the different values that the keys can take refer to the source code in `constants.py`.

## üóÇÔ∏è Modules

OTAF is modular and extensible, with the following key components:

- **`assembly_modeling`**: Base classes for mechanical assemblies. **MOST IMPORTANT MODULE**
- **`geometry`**: Geometric functions for validating geometry, point clouds, etc.
- **`optimization`**: Tools for solving SOC optimization with diverse approaches.
- **`sampling`**: Sampling distributions of defects or defect parameters.
- **`distribution`**: Modeling distributions based on `assembly_modeling` objects and other specialized tools.
- **`surrogate`**: Experimental methods to create surrogate models for the SOC.
- **`uncertainty`**: Methods for reliability analyses and failure probability estimation.

Explore the [source code](https://github.com/Kramer84/otaf/src/otaf/) for a complete overview.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether you're reporting a bug, suggesting a feature, or submitting a pull request, your help is appreciated. There is still significant work to do to support a broader variety of cases. As the product of three years of PhD research, some parts of the code may not yet be fully optimized for adding new feature types or handling form defects. Legacy code for experimental tools, such as neural network-based surrogate models, may also require further refinement.
