## üìö Introduction

**OTAF** (Open Tolerance Analysis Framework) is an open-source Python library designed for statistical tolerance analysis and modeling of overconstrained 3D mechanical assemblies. It provides tools to quantify uncertainty, perform sensitivity analysis, and estimate the effect of in the context of manufacturing and design. It also provides a basis for constructing a System Of Constraint (SOC) based assembly model, given a minimal representation of the assembly and its constituting parts, automatically.

Key use cases include:
- **Modeling Manufacturing Deviations**: Analyze the effects of geometric and dimensional variations.
- **Probabilistic Failure Estimation**: Leverage advanced statistical tools to quantify and mitigate risk.
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Account for imprecise probabilities in design and manufacturing.

Limitations :
- **Only rigid transformations**: Only rigid defects (translation + rotations) are modelled
- **Only planar and cylindrical features**: The methods have only been developed for these two geometric objects for now.
- **No tools for tolerance allocation**: But can be easily made on your side once you have the SOC model


This package has been written to explore experimental approaches based on imprecise probabilities, read the associated paper.

This work is supported by the [French National Research Agency (ANR)](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-21-CE46-0009) under the project "Analyse des tol√©rances avec les probabilit√©s impr√©cises" (ANR-21-CE46-0009). The goal is to develop new formalisms for tolerance analysis based on imprecise probabilities, bridging the gap between theory and industrial applications.
